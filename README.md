# Gyosa

**GYOSA** is a privacy-preserving machine learning solution developed on top of [SOTERIA](https://github.com/claudiavmbrito/Soteria), [GLOW](https://github.com/projectglow/glow) and [Apache Spark](https://github.com/apache/spark) by resorting to [Gramine](https://github.com/gramineproject/gramine).

Built upon the concept of computation partitioning, **GYOSA** allows running GWASes inside the enclaves while running non-sensitive code outside. 
The main goal of **GYOSA** is to provide the community with a privacy-preserving and distributed solution to run genomic analysis in untrusted third-party infrastructures. 

**Note 1**: This is an academic proof-of-concept prototype and has not received careful code review. This implementation is NOT ready for production use.

**Note 2**: This repository is being updated according to current submission.

## Getting Started

The code for **GYOSA** will be fully published here **soon** along with information on all its dependencies.

To offer an easy-to-use guide, we provide scripts to install all the components.
